## Overview

We covered the following topis in the workshop 
* Data Manipulation
  * Numpy
  * Pandas
  * Scipy
* Data Visualization
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
  
## NumPy

Numpy is one of the most fundamental libraries for using Python in the field of Machine Learning. NumPy is a numerical library for Python that allows extremely fast data handling anf generation. It utilises arrays that can store data much more efficiently than a regular Python list. NumPy is extremely important to learn before learning about the Pandas library. The topics covered are :

1. Environment Setup (`pip3 install numpy`)
2. NumPy Arrays
3. NumPy Operations
4. NumPy Array Indexing
5. NumPy Matrices

## SciPy

Mathematics and scientific research has to be the most sacred domain of science, and to solve their underlying problems, SciPy is the messiah
SciPy is a free and open-source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing. SciPy contains modules for **optimization**, **linear algebra**, **integration**, **interpolation**, **special functions**, **FFT**, **signal and image processing**, **ODE solvers** and other tasks common in science and engineering

1. Environment setup (`pip3 install scipy`)
   - If the above does not work, (`pip install git+https://github.com/scipy/scipy.git`)
   - Since NumPy is a dependency, it should be installed as well
2. Subpackages in SciPy
3. Basic Functions
4. Special Functions
5. Integration Functions
6. Linear Algebra
7. Interpolation Functions

## Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is one of the most popular Python packages used for data visualization. It is a cross-platform library for making 2D plots from data in arrays. Matplotlib is written in Python and makes use of NumPy, the numerical mathematics extension of Python. It provides an object-oriented API that helps in embedding plots in applications using Python GUI toolkits. The topics covered were :

1. Environment Setup (`pip3 install matplotlib`)
2. Matplotlib Basics
3. Subplots
4. Object Oriented Interface
5. Grids
6. Formatting Axes
7. Other types of plots 

## Seaborn

In the world of Analytics, the best way to get insights is by visualizing the data. Data can be visualized by representing it as plots which is easy to understand, explore and grasp. Such data helps in drawing the attention of key elements.

To analyse a set of data using Python, we make use of Matplotlib, a widely implemented 2D plotting library. Likewise, Seaborn is a visualization library in Python. It is built on top of Matplotlib.

Seaborn Vs Matplotlib
It is summarized that if Matplotlib “tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible”, Seaborn tries to make a well-defined set of hard things easy too.” In most cases, you will still use Matplotlib for simple plotting. The knowledge of Matplotlib is recommended to tweak Seaborn’s default plots. The topics covered are : 

1. Environment Setup (`pip install seaborn`)
2. Different types of plots(jointplot, pairplot, violinplot, boxplot, etc)
3. Heatmap
4. Clustermap
5. Grids
6. Regression plots
7. Formatting axes
