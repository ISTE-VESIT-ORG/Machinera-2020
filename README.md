<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Imagine looking at a graph to explore your data. In two dimensions everything makes sense. In three it gets complex, but how do we look at data that has 200 dimensions?
It would happen to you that you have to read a thousand documents in a week, you couldn't handle it.

What these things have to do with AI?
AI used to be a fanciful concept from science fiction, but now it’s becoming a daily reality. AI can mean different things in different contexts for different people.
For data scientists, it is a good excuse to build cool stuff whereas for end-users AI means to ease the workload.
So there's a good reason to be enthusiastic about AI and that brings the next question to all of us "How do I get started to build a career in Data Science, AI, or ML?
Don't you worry!
We have got you covered.

So, coming to the point, what you will get to learn from this series. We will be covering all the domains and concepts under the umbrella of Artificial intelligence. This series is going to have multiple courses, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn,  Matplotlib, Scipy, Dataset Generation, Web Scraping, Data preprocessing, Big Data, Deep learning and much much more!

### Built With
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get going with the repo and AI concepts we expect you to follow all the topics in the given manner, which eventually will lead to end of the series.
