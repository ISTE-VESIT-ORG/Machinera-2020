<!-- ## What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is an branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

## Types of Machine learning
 
## Supervised Learning

### Regression

Regression analysis consists of a set of machine learning methods that allow us to predict a ***continuous outcome variable (y)*** based on the value of one or multiple ***predictor variables (x)***. Briefly, the goal of regression model is to build a mathematical equation that defines y as a function of the x variables. The course shows the working of ***_[Linear Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html), [Polynomial Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html), [Decision Tree Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html), [Random Forest Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html) and [Support Vector Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVR.html)._***

### Classification

In machine learning, classification refers to a predictive modeling problem where a ***class label*** is predicted for a ***given example of input data***. Given one or more inputs a classification model will try to predict the value of one or more outcomes. Outcomes are labels that can be applied to a dataset. The course shows the working of ***_[K-Nearest Neighbour Classification](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html), [Decision Tree Classification](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html), [Random Forest Classification](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) and [Support Vector Classification](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html)._***

## Unsupervised Learning

### Clustering
Cluster analysis, or clustering, is an unsupervised machine learning task. It involves automatically discovering ***natural grouping in data***. Unlike supervised learning (like predictive modeling), clustering algorithms only interpret the input data and find natural groups or clusters in feature space. The course shows the working of ***_ [K-Mean Clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html)_***.
